    To make it run in the background, which we definitely want, we need to
    have it play stuff in a new thread.

    How hard can that be?

      - Has the button's corresponding function been called already
      - What button sequence has been pushed

    The button sequence should be cleared when the handset is set down.

class Phone(object):

    This class holds all the bits for the phone, and commands them all.

    It should be able to do the following:
      - When the handset is lifted, start the intro clip playing
      - When a button is pushed, play the corresponding DTMF tone
      - When the user presses the correct button, play a random old recording
      - When the user presses the correct button, start making a new recording
      - When the user presses the correct button, play the most recent recording
      - When the handset is replaced, stop all playback and clear the button sequence

    This should all be able to handle stuff happening asyncronously - the user
    can press a button during playback, and a tone should still play OVER the
    existing stream.
