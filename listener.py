class Dictaphone(object):
    '''
    This class acts as a dictaphone (obviously). It should have the following capabilities:
      - play a recorded message
      - record a new message

    How hard can that be?
    '''



class PhoneMonitor(object):
    '''
    This class should listen for two things:
      - Buttons being pressed currently
      - If the handset is lifted or not

    It should also track a few things:
      - Has the button's corresponding function been called already
      - What button sequence has been pushed

    The button sequence should be cleared when the handset is set down.
    '''



class Phone(object):
    '''
    This class holds all the bits for the phone, and commands them all.

    It should be able to do the following:
      - When the handset is lifted, start the intro clip playing
      - When a button is pushed, play the corresponding DTMF tone
      - When the user presses the correct button, play a random old recording
      - When the user presses the correct button, start making a new recording
      - When the user presses the correct button, play the most recent recording
      - When the handset is replaced, stop all playback and clear the button sequence

    This should all be able to handle stuff happening asyncronously - the user
    can press a button during playback, and a tone should still play OVER the
    existing stream.
